## Database Seeding

The application is seeded using `faker`.  It seeds 40 parks, half are state and half are national.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
* [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)

## Installation

In your terminal:
* `git clone https://github.com/gravytates/parks_api.git`
* `cd parks_api`
* `bundle install`
* Open another terminal window and type `postgres`.  Leave this window open.
* In your first terminal window type:
* `bundle exec rake db:setup`
* `bundle exec rake db:test:prepare`

You can test the API in Postman.

## Development server

Run `bundle exec rails s` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

* If you would like to make changes to this project, do so in a text editor.
* Make frequent commits with detailed comments.
* Submit changes as pull request to Asia at akane0915 on Github.
* URL: localhost:3000/

## Calling API from another application
